# Decision Tree-Based Diabetes Prediction with Pruning Techniques

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts diabetes using a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a structured diabetes dataset. The project focuses on reducing overfitting by implementing both pre-pruning and post-pruning strategies and evaluating their impact on model performance.

## Project Workflow:

Dataset loading and exploratory analysis

Data preprocessing and feature preparation

Training an unpruned Decision Tree model

Applying pre-pruning to limit tree growth

Applying post-pruning using cost complexity pruning

Model evaluation and comparison

## Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas 

Scikit-learn
