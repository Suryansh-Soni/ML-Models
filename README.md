# DecisionTree-ML
Diabetes prediction using a Decision Tree classifier on a medical CSV dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Both pre-pruning (max depth, min samples) and post-pruning (cost complexity pruning) are applied to reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
